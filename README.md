# Dynamic Programming Euler's Number

The mathematical constant $e$ (Euler's number) is defined as follows:

$$ e = \sum^{\infty}_{i=0} \frac{1}{i!} = \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1} +
\frac{1}{1\cdot 2} + \frac{1}{1\cdot 2\cdot 3} + \frac{1}{1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot
4} + \ldots$$

I've provided an implementation of a function to approximate $e$ up to a number
of $n$ terms in `code.js` for you. However, it does repeated work -- identify
where the repeated work occurs and avoid it through bottom-up dynamic
programming (not memoization). Change the implementation accordingly.

Test your new functions; I've provided some basic testing code in `code.test.js`
but you need to go beyond that.

## Runtime Analysis

What is the worst-case big $\Theta$ time complexity of your algorithm?

For this algorithm, the main body of the code is the for loop which will
iterate for n number of times because we start the loop at 1, to avoid 
doing extra work to calculate zero, and we end when our iteration reaches n. 
The variable initializations in the beginning and the calculations performed 
within the for loop take constant amount of time, so they can be dropped. 
Therefore, our worst case $\Theta$ complexity is $\Theta(n)$!
